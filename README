The Gizmo is a piece of software to assist communities in dividing labor (and money) in an egalitarian manner. I am not the creator, but picked up maintenance after moving into my current house.

IMPORTANT: If you want to use the e-mail reminder feature, configure the mail server in House.java.

To build: Run 'make'.

To run: Run './gizmo.sh'.

Tested on Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X.
